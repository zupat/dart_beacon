### This example demonstrates how to use `Beacon.progress` to create animations.

It uses a progress beacon to animate a bouncing ball. The `onProgress` callback calculates the ball's height based on the current progress, creating a parabolic bounce effect. It also shows how to control the animation (start, pause, resume) by watching its status.
